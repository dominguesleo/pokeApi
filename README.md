# Entrega API - Desarrollo de Interfaces

This project corresponds to the submission of the initial assignment for the course 'Interface Development,' aimed at demonstrating proficiency in integrating an API within our project.

Project Features:
- We have created a React project using Vite.
- The PokeAPI has been utilized as a service to fetch data.
- Axios library has been added to handle HTTP requests.
- Tanstack Query was used to perform asynchronous requests, cache previously fetched data, and manage "Pending" states to display a loading screen and "Success" states to render the data.
- We used the Material UI library to implement the loading screen and the icons for the buttons.
- The rest of the component styles have been created using native CSS, including the dynamic statistics bars.
